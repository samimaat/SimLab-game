# What's the Game about?

The game is inspired by Andy Weir's Hail Mary Project where the protagonist Ryland Grace exhibits the basic instincts and curiosity of a scientist encountering new life.

I wish to recreate a simulated scientific laboratory environment where you are tasked with finding out properties of unknown elements, substances and possibly life.

## The Gameplay Loop

You choose an instrument to investigate your chosen element.

# Progress

The contains one unknown substance 'unknownium'. It has several properties such as 
- melting point
- boiling point
- 'appearance' as in what color it appears to be in set lighting

You can cycle between different instruments.

The game has following instruments:
- Heatbox: You can place the substance inside and change **the temperature** to see what happens to the phase of the substance.
- Lightbox: You can place the substance inside and change **the color of the light** inside the box and figure out the color of the substance.

# How to play the game

1. Download the 'game' folder and execute the SimLab.py. The game is played on the command line.
2. To exit the game either close the command line or use the keyboard interrupt Ctrl + C.

# UI elements

- command line
- choose which element or biological thing to study
    - element is a basically a dictionary of properties
        - how temperature affects it: freezing point, melting point, boiling point â†’ leads to finding it out
        - how radiation affects it: ...
        - how light affects it, is it see through, opaque does it reflect light, which wave lengths
        - smell?
        - mass?
        - magnetism: is it a metal? or not?
        - conductivity?
        - pressure
        - pH level (acidity, base)
        - crystal structure (8 different kinds)
