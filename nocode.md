- command line
- choose which element or biological thing to study
    - element is a basically a dictionary of properties
        - how temperature affects it: freezing point, melting point, boiling point → leads to finding it out
        - how radiation affects it: ...
        - how light affects it, is it see through, opaque does it reflect light, which wave lengths
        - smell?
        - mass?
        - magnetism: is it a metal? or not?
        - conductivity?
        - pressure
        - pH level (acidity, base)
        - crystal structure (8 different kinds)
